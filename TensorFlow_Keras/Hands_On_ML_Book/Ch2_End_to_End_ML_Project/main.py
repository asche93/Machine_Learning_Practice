Description:
    This script implements an end-to-end machine learning project workflow as described in Chapter 2
    of "Hands-On Machine Learning". The main steps covered include:
    - Loading and exploring a dataset
    - Data cleaning and preprocessing
    - Feature engineering
    - Splitting the data into training and testing sets
    - Training a machine learning model
    - Evaluating the model's performance
    - Fine-tuning the model using hyperparameter optimization

Dataset:
    - Housing dataset provided by the book or sourced from the StatLib repository.

Notes:
    - The implementation closely follows the book's example but may include additional comments,
      visualizations, or experiments for personal learning purposes.
    - For more details, refer to the book: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/
