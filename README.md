# Machine_Learning_Practice

This repository contains my implementations, experiments, and notes as I learn and practice machine learning concepts using TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch. By working through tutorials, books, and personal projects, I aim to develop a deep understanding of both frameworks and their applications.

## Goals

- **Learn by Doing:** Implement machine learning models from scratch and using libraries like TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch.
- **Framework Comparison:** Explore similarities and differences between TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch by solving similar problems in both.
- **Solidify Concepts:** Add detailed comments and notes to explain the core ideas and techniques.
- **Reusable Reference:** Create a structured repository to revisit and reuse knowledge for future projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:
